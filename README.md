# Number-Guesser-Game
Codecademy Project is a number-guessing game.
The project is to create 4 JS functions to power the game. The code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal.
//Function (1 of 4) should return a secret, random integer between 0 and 9 at the start of each new round
// Function (2 of 4), determines which player wins based on which guess is closer, human wins if tied, returns true if human wins and false if computer wins.
// Function (3 of 4) Parameter will be a string value representing the winner, increases the score variable (humanScore or computerScore) by 1 depending on winner passed in to updateScore, string passed in will be either 'human' or 'computer', does not need to return any value.
// Function (4 of 4) should increase value of currentRoundNumber by 1
